      <p>
        PhantomNet is a honeypot monitoring dashboard that visualizes
        suspicious and safe network events captured from decoy systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        This frontend currently uses mock data and will later be connected
        to real backend APIs and AI-based threat analysis.
