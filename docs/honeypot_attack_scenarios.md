# Supported Attack Patterns

## SSH Attack Scenarios
- Brute-force login attempts
- Credential guessing
- System reconnaissance (whoami, uname, ls)
- Privilege discovery (sudo, id)
- Destructive intent simulation (rm -rf)

## HTTP Attack Scenarios
- Admin login brute-force
- SQL injection payloads
- HTTP method abuse (PUT, DELETE)
- Form tampering
- Rate-limit abuse

## FTP Attack Scenarios
- Anonymous access attempts
- Invalid credential brute-force
- Directory enumeration (LIST)
- File exfiltration attempts (RETR)

## Attack Simulation Approach
All attacks are controlled and simulated.
No real files, credentials, or system resources are exposed.
