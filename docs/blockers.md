## Week 2 Observed Issues

1. SSH honeypot uses simulated protocol responses (not full SSH stack)
2. HTTP honeypot currently logs locally before DB ingestion
3. AI threat_score is placeholder (rule-based / dummy)
4. No session correlation across protocols yet
5. No async ingestion pipeline (direct API writes)
