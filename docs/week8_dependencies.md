# Week 8 Kickoff Dependencies
## Frontend Integration Readiness

---

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines all dependencies required to begin Week 8 development
without delays or integration issues.

---

## 2. Backend Dependencies

- ML Prediction API (v2) deployed and accessible
- Explainability fields available as optional metadata
- Stable response contracts as defined in API documentation

---

## 3. ML & Data Dependencies

- Week 6 dataset and preprocessing pipeline finalized
- MLflow tracking server available for experiment reference
- Model artifacts stable and versioned

---

## 4. Frontend Dependencies

- Explainability component available in shared component library
- Frontend build environment configured
- API endpoint configuration finalized

---

## 5. Environment Dependencies

- Development environment fully set up
- Network access to backend services
- Required environment variables documented

---

## 6. Assumptions

- Explainability data remains optional
- API response structure remains stable during Week 8
- No major UI redesign planned during integration phase

---

## 7. Risk Notes

- Delay in backend deployment may impact integration timelines
- Changes to API contracts must be reflected in documentation immediately
